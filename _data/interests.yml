    description: I have a good understanding of video editing particularly in Davinci Resolve. Photoshop is near and dear although
      for basic work or personal stuff (I am no picasso though ðŸ˜…)
  - title: 2. Open Source
    description: Even though I did release a couple of OS packages myself I mostly enjoy peeking
      into what other people have done and contribute there. In my opinion this is where you learn most. Interacting
      with people you don't interact on a daily basis can yield new knowledge and friendships.
  - title: 3. Data Science and Machine Learning
    description: Ever since the AI boom with ChatGPT I've been having an itch to jump into
      studying about this subject. Have completed the Zero To Mastery course on Data Science and Machine Learning
      but have yet to work on anything real. Keen to jump in.
  - title: 4. Product Development
    description: When working on some new feature I don't like to be just the coder. I like to be involved in feature development
      from scratch. That means covering the business decisions behind why we need the feature and analysing how
      it's gonna impact the end user.
