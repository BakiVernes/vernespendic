    testimony: Vernes isn't just a master of the Rails framework, he's also conquered the art of beard-growing and
      bicep-bulking. While his head lacks coverage, his chin and muscles compensate exponentially. They say his
      code is as robust as his gluteus, and let's face it, both are more than impressive!
