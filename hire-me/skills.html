          Ruby is the language I used the most in the past couple of years. Used it in tandem with Rails, for Ruby-only
          gem contributions, and scripting as well. More than the syntax I love the open source nature that surrounds it and the community as well.

          My JS journey started with jQuery early in university. As javascript evolved so did my understanding of it. My workplace
          demanded a whole Rails app rewrite from jQuery to vanilla JS. This strengthened my foundational knowledge and down the road
          helped me easily jump in to any javascript flavor like typescript or frameworks like Vue.

          Every web devs bread and butter. Over the years I have recognized the importance of semantic HTML not just for
          screen readers but for the easier understanding of my teammates. Adding the ever important sprinkle of TailwindCSS
          on top, it made prototyping layouts faster and easier then ever.

        Often overlooked, particularly by good coders, soft skills are a thing of beauty and nuance. You cannot acquire
        them with some tutorial on Udemy. My journey from a shy coder to a good teammate went from being mentored by the best
        to mentoring, presenting and writing code in a way that would be understandable down the road for anyone.

        Natively speaking Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian. My fluency in English is near-native, allowing me to effortlessly

        I have a good understanding of video editing particularly in Davinci Resolve. Photoshop is near and dear although
        for basic work or personal stuff (I am no picasso though 😅). My other interests include:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          Open Source Contributions. Even though I did release a couple of OS packages myself I mostly enjoy peeking
          into what other people have done and contribute there. In my opinion this is where you learn most. Interacting
          with people you don't interact on a daily basis can yield new knowledge and friendships.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
          Data Science and Machine Learning. Ever since the AI boom with ChatGPT I've been having an itch to jump into
          studying about this subject. Have completed the Zero To Mastery course on Data Science and Machine Learning
          but have yet to work on anything real. Keen to jump in.
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>

        <li>
          When working on some new feature I don't like to be just the coder. I like to be involved in feature development
          from scratch. That means covering the business decisions behind why we need the feature and analysing how
          it's gonna impact the end user.
